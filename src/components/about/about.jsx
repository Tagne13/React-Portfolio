        <p>I graduated from Saginaw Valley State University in 2004 with a B.S. in Athletic Training. I then went on to be accepted into the physical therapy program at Oakland University and completed my Doctorate of Physical Therapy in 2009. Both during and post-COVID pandemic I became dissatisfied with the healthcare industry as a whole and sought out a career that was more in-tune with my current interests and more suited to my strengths. My passions include learning, traveling, being outdoors in nature, and experiencing different cultures.</p>
